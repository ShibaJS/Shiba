Contribution Workflow
=====================
You can contribute to Shiba with issues and PRs. Simply filing issues for problems you encounter is a great way to contribute. Contributing implementations is greatly appreciated.

## Suggested Workflow

We use and recommend the following workflow:

1. Create an issue for your work. 
    - You can skip this step for trivial changes.
    - Reuse an existing issue on the topic, if there is one.
    - Get agreement from the team and the community that your proposed change is a good one.
    - If your change adds a new API, please confirm that all the platform can provide the same api.
    - Clearly state that you are going to take on implementing it, if that's the case. You can request that the issue be assigned to you. Note: The issue filer and the implementer don't have to be the same person.
2. Create a personal fork of the repository on GitHub (if you don't already have one).
3. Create a branch off of master (`git checkout -b mybranch`). 
    - Name the branch so that it clearly communicates your intentions, such as issue/123. 
    - Branches are useful since they isolate your changes from incoming changes from upstream. They also enable you to create multiple PRs from the same fork.
4. Make and commit your changes.
    - Please follow our [Commit Messages](#commit-messages) guidance.
5. Add new tests corresponding to your change, if applicable.
6. Build the repository with your changes.
    - Make sure that the builds are clean.
    - Make sure that the tests are all passing, including your new tests.
7. Create a pull request (PR) against the upstream repository's **master** branch.
    - Push your changes to your fork on GitHub (if you haven't already).

Note: It is OK for your PR to include a large number of commits. Once your change is accepted, you will be asked to squash your commits into one or some appropriately small number of commits before your PR is merged.

Note: It is OK to create your PR as "[WIP]" on the upstream repo before the implementation is done. This can be useful if you'd like to start the feedback process concurrent with your implementation. State that this is the case in the initial PR comment.

Commit Messages
---------------

Please format commit messages as follows (based on [A Note About Git Commit Messages](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)):

```
Summarize change in 50 characters or less

Provide more detail after the first line. Leave one blank line below the
summary and wrap all lines at 72 characters or less.

If the change fixes an issue, leave another blank line after the final
paragraph and indicate which issue is fixed in the specific format
below.

Fix #1
```

Also do your best to factor commits appropriately, not too large with unrelated things in the same commit, and not too small with the same small change applied N times in N different commits.

DOs and DON'Ts
--------------

Please do:

* **DO** follow the language's offical code style. (we use [this code style](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coding-conventions.html) for kotlin code, etc.)
* **DO** give priority to the current style of the project or file you're changing even if it diverges from the general guidelines.
* **DO** make sure that all the platform that we maintained have the same behavior.
* **DO** include tests when adding new features. When fixing bugs, start with
  adding a test that highlights how the current behavior is broken.
* **DO** keep the discussions focused. When a new or related topic comes up
  it's often better to create new issue than to side track the discussion.
* **DO** blog and tweet (or whatever) about your contributions, frequently!


Please do not:

* **DON'T** make PRs for style changes. 
* **DON'T** surprise us with big pull requests. Instead, file an issue and start
  a discussion so we can agree on a direction before you invest a large amount
  of time.
* **DON'T** commit code that you didn't write. If you find code that you think is a good fit to add to Shiba, file an issue and start a discussion before proceeding.
* **DON'T** submit PRs that alter licensing related files or headers. If you believe there's a problem with them, file an issue and we'll be happy to discuss it.
* **DON'T** add API additions without filing an issue and discussing with us first.
